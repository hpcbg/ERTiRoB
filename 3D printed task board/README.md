# Task Board Fully 3D Printed Design

This folder contains [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/) drawings for complete 3D printing of the Task Board.

Two versions are available: [normal](task_board_normal.scad) and a [compact](task_board_compact.scad) (with reduced height) one.

The [STLs](./STLs/) folder contains the current cersion of the STL files for the 3D printing. The base and cover can be printed either as a whole piece on a large printer bed or from two pieces on small printer bed (20cm x 20cm) and then to be glued together.

The required components can be found in the [Bill of materials.pdf](./Bill%20of%20materials.pdf).

_Remark:_ Some of the files are taken from the original repository of the Task Board - [https://github.com/peterso/robotlearningblock](https://github.com/peterso/robotlearningblock).
